What Is My Purpose?

A. To find out the which country has the most defective rate.

How Did I Do This?

A. In any hypothesis testing the process flows in a true or false manner. we all know that one way anova test is performed when we have 3 or more discrete inputs and if we want to find a output which is dscrete too. So, at first I tried to convert each respective column into an individual array and verified if the data followed normal distribtuion. Now i have used the funciton the chi2_contingency funciton to find out which has the highest value to make a decision
